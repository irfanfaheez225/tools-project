    <p>Lack of equipment is the main obstacle when it comes to working on vehicles, not a lack of patience or ignorance. The right tools can make all the difference in getting a task done efficiently and correctly.

        However, if youâ€™re stuck without them the chances are a small task becomes a lengthy task, the problem will get worse, or nothing will be fixed at all.
